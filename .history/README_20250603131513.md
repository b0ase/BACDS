# 🖼️ JPEG Renamer - Bitcoin Address Edition

A desktop application that renames your JPEG files using randomly generated Type 1 Bitcoin addresses. Perfect for anonymizing your photo collection or creating unique, cryptographically-inspired filenames.

## Features

- 🔒 **Secure Bitcoin Address Generation**: Uses cryptographically secure random generation for authentic Type 1 Bitcoin addresses
- 📁 **Batch Processing**: Select and rename multiple JPEG files at once
- 🎨 **Modern UI**: Clean, intuitive interface with real-time feedback
- ✅ **Safe Operation**: Prevents overwrites and provides detailed results
- 🖥️ **Cross-Platform**: Works on macOS, Windows, and Linux

## How It Works

The app generates random Type 1 Bitcoin addresses (starting with "1") by:

1. Creating a cryptographically secure random private key
2. Generating a public key hash using SHA256 and RIPEMD160
3. Adding version bytes and checksums
4. Encoding in Base58 format

Each generated address is unique and follows the Bitcoin mainnet address format.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 16 or higher)
- npm or yarn

### Setup

1. Clone or download this repository
2. Open a terminal in the project directory
3. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

## Usage

### Development Mode

To run the app in development mode with debugging tools:

```bash
npm run dev
```

### Production Mode

To run the app normally:

```bash
npm start
```

### Building Executables

To create distributable executables for your platform:

```bash
npm run build
```

The built applications will be in the `dist` folder.

## How to Use the App

1. **Launch the Application**
   - Run the app using one of the commands above
   - The main window will open with a clean interface

2. **Select JPEG Files**
   - Click the "📁 Select JPEG Files" button
   - Choose one or more JPEG files from the file picker
   - Supported formats: .jpg, .jpeg (case insensitive)

3. **Review Selected Files**
   - View the list of selected files
   - Remove any files you don't want to rename using the "❌ Remove" button

4. **Rename Files**
   - Click the "🔄 Rename Files" button
   - The app will generate unique Bitcoin addresses for each file
   - Files will be renamed in their original location

5. **View Results**
   - See detailed results for each file operation
   - Successfully renamed files show the new Bitcoin address
   - Any errors are clearly displayed

## Example

**Original filename:** `vacation_photo.jpg`  
**New filename:** `1A1zP1eP5QGefi2DMPTfTL5SLmv7DivfNa.jpg`

## Technical Details

### Bitcoin Address Format

- **Type**: Pay-to-Public-Key-Hash (P2PKH)
- **Network**: Bitcoin Mainnet
- **Format**: Base58Check encoding
- **Length**: 26-35 characters
- **Prefix**: Always starts with "1"

### Security

- Uses Node.js crypto module for secure random number generation
- Implements proper Bitcoin address validation with checksums
- No private keys are stored or transmitted

### File Safety

- Checks for existing files before renaming to prevent overwrites
- Preserves original file extensions
- Operates only in the original file directories
- Provides detailed error reporting

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Files not showing up after selection:**
- Ensure you're selecting JPEG files (.jpg, .jpeg)
- Check file permissions

**Rename operation fails:**
- Verify you have write permissions in the file directory
- Ensure the files aren't currently open in another application
- Check that there's enough disk space

**App won't start:**
- Ensure Node.js is properly installed
- Run `npm install` to install missing dependencies
- Try running in development mode with `npm run dev`

### Bitcoin Address Generation

The app implements a simplified but authentic Bitcoin address generation process:

1. **Private Key**: 32 random bytes
2. **Public Key Hash**: RIPEMD160(SHA256(privateKey))
3. **Versioned Payload**: 0x00 + publicKeyHash
4. **Checksum**: First 4 bytes of SHA256(SHA256(versionedPayload))
5. **Final Address**: Base58(versionedPayload + checksum)
