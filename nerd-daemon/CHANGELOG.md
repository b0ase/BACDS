# NERD Daemon Changelog

## v2.0.0 - Phase 3 Complete (2024-07-22)

### 🎉 Major Milestone: P2P Enhancements & Foundational BSV Payments

This release marks the completion of Phase 3, significantly expanding the NERD daemon's capabilities with decentralized peer discovery, a built-in tracker, and a foundational Bitcoin SV micropayment system.

### ✅ Added

-   **Distributed Hash Table (DHT) Implementation**
    -   Kademlia-based DHT for robust and decentralized peer discovery using `github.com/anacrolix/dht/v2`.
    -   Integrated DHT server for announcing the daemon and finding other NERD peers.
    -   Dynamic peer quality metrics and management within the DHT context.
    -   Placeholder functions for NERD-specific data storage and retrieval via DHT.

-   **Integrated BitTorrent Tracker Server**
    -   HTTP and UDP tracker interfaces for compatibility with standard BitTorrent clients.
    -   Handles announce and scrape requests.
    -   NERD-specific extensions for peer quality and payment-related information.
    -   Statistics and peer lifecycle management (cleanup of old peers).

-   **BSV Micropayment System (Foundational)**
    -   Integration with `github.com/bsv-blockchain/go-sdk` for Bitcoin SV operations.
    -   Private key management (WIF) and BSV address generation.
    -   Creation of BSV transactions:
        -   Fetching UTXOs (placeholder, using live API in `bsv_payments.go` v2.0.0).
        -   Adding inputs and outputs (P2PKH).
        -   OP_RETURN data for NERD-specific metadata.
        -   Fee calculation (sat/byte) and change output generation.
    -   Transaction signing using the configured private key.
    -   Transaction broadcasting (placeholder, using live API in `bsv_payments.go` v2.0.0).
    -   Placeholder for payment channel management.

-   **Configuration Enhancements**
    -   Extended `config.json` to support DHT, Tracker, and BSV Payment settings (ports, enable flags, API URLs, private keys, etc.).
    -   Graceful loading of configuration with default values.

-   **Build & Stability**
    -   Resolved numerous SDK-specific issues and linter errors for BSV payment integration.
    -   Successfully built the daemon with all Phase 3 features (`nerd-daemon-phase3-final`).

### 🛠️ Technical Implementation

-   **DHT**: Leveraged `anacrolix/dht/v2` and `anacrolix/torrent/metainfo`.
-   **Tracker**: Custom implementation using standard Go `net/http` and `net`.
-   **BSV Payments**: Utilized `github.com/bsv-blockchain/go-sdk` for core cryptographic and transaction functions.
-   **Error Handling**: Improved error handling across new modules.

### 📁 Updated Project Structure

```

├── main.go                # Main daemon, P2P, DHT, Tracker, BSV integration
├── protocol.go            # BitTorrent wire protocol
├── dht.go                 # Kademlia DHT implementation
├── tracker.go             # BitTorrent tracker server
├── bsv_payments.go        # BSV micropayment system
├── ... (other files)
```

### 🚀 Next Phase: Finalizing BSV Payments & Content Features

The daemon is now poised for:
-   Implementing live UTXO fetching and transaction broadcasting for BSV payments (partially done, needs robust error handling and config for different explorers if needed).
-   Finalizing payment channel logic.
-   Developing advanced content discovery and search mechanisms.
-   Enhancing security features.

### 🧪 Testing

-   Individual modules (DHT, Tracker, BSV Payments) built and integrated.
-   Basic functionality of each module confirmed through integration into `main.go`.
-   Further end-to-end testing and specific test scripts for new features are recommended.

## v1.0.0 - Phase 2 Complete (2025-06-04)

### 🎉 Major Milestone: BitTorrent Wire Protocol Implementation

This release marks the completion of Phase 2 of the NERD daemon development, delivering a complete BitTorrent-compatible P2P networking foundation.

### ✅ Added
- **Complete BitTorrent Wire Protocol Implementation**
  - Traditional handshake protocol for BitTorrent compatibility
  - Length-prefixed message format with Protocol Buffer payloads
  - Message serialization/deserialization using Protocol Buffers
  
- **Comprehensive Message Type Support (15+ types)**
  - Standard BitTorrent messages (0-9): Handshake, KeepAlive, Choke, Unchoke, Interested, NotInterested, Have, Bitfield, Request, Piece, Cancel, Port
  - NERD-specific messages (100+): PaymentRequest, PaymentProof, TokenBalance, QualityMetrics, GeographicHint
  
- **Production-Ready Networking Foundation**
  - TCP connection management with thread-safe connection pooling
  - Graceful connection lifecycle management with proper cleanup
  - Robust error handling for network operations and message parsing
  - Support for both incoming and outgoing connections
  
- **Protocol Buffer Integration**
  - Complete message schema definitions in `messages.proto`
  - Generated Go code with proper module structure
  - Binary-efficient message serialization

### 🛠️ Technical Implementation
- **Language**: Go (chosen for performance, concurrency, and productivity)
- **Serialization**: Protocol Buffers (efficient binary format)
- **Architecture**: Modular design with separate protocol and networking layers
- **Concurrency**: Thread-safe connection pool with mutex synchronization
- **Compatibility**: Traditional BitTorrent handshake for interoperability
