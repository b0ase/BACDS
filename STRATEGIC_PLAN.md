## 💡 INNOVATION: BITNET ARCHITECTURE

### **Bitcoin Address as Network Endpoint Concept**

```
Traditional CDN:
User → DNS → CDN Edge Server → Origin Server → Content

BitNet P2P Network:
User → Bitcoin Address → IPv6 Resolution → Direct Peer → Content
     → Payment Verification → Access Granted
```

### **Technical Implementation Ideas**

1. **Address-to-IP Mapping:**
   ```javascript
   // Deterministic IPv6 from Bitcoin address
   function bitcoinToIPv6(bitcoinAddress) {
     // Hash Bitcoin address to create IPv6 suffix
     // Use DHT to map to actual device IP
     // Enable direct peer-to-peer communication
   }
   ```

2. **Peer Discovery Protocol:**
   - DHT (Distributed Hash Table) using Bitcoin addresses as keys
   - IPv6 multicast for local network discovery
   - Tor integration for privacy-preserving connections

3. **Payment-Gated Access:**
   - Verify Bitcoin payment to address before content delivery
   - Micropayments for pay-per-view content
   - Subscription models via recurring payments
