# Product Names and Tokenization Concepts

This document outlines the various names considered for the project and explores the possibility of tokenizing and marketing different components of the system.

## Potential Project Names:

*   **BACDS:** Stands for Bitcoin-Addressed Content Delivery. Liked for being descriptive of the core function.
*   **BitStream:** Mentioned as a potentially good name, but its specific use case or role was unclear.
*   **FogNet:** Considered but discarded due to perceived negative connotations.
*   **BitNet:** A brief idea, quickly superseded.
*   **$NERD:** (Network Endpoint Redistribution Daemon) Currently the preferred name, especially for the network and token.

Currently, there is some overlap and potential confusion with having multiple names associated with the project/system. The strategic plan uses "NERD" for the network/token and "BACDS" for the desktop application.

## Concept: Tokenizing System Components

The idea is to potentially tokenize different, distinct parts of the BACDS/NERD system. This could allow for:

*   Separate marketing and sale of specific functionalities or services.
*   Creating distinct economic models or incentives for different components.
*   Modular development and potentially attracting different user bases for each tokenized part.

Further discussion is needed to identify which components could be effectively tokenized and how their tokens would interact within the overall ecosystem.
